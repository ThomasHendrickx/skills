name: domain-events
description: Use when a state change must reach another bounded context or outside system (email, bus, third-party API), others must learn what happened, or a consumer must survive redelivery or reordering.

```yaml
purpose: >
  The aggregate records a past-tense event in the same unit of work as its change (domain-modelling);
  the use case writes it to an outbox table in that transaction (problems 2, 3). A relay publishes
  outbox rows after commit, at least once, with retry (problem 2). Across contexts, an integration
  event: a versioned published contract mapped from the internal event (problems 1, 3). Consumers are
  idempotent and check the aggregate version (problem 4). Inside one context, follow-up work is an
  explicit call in the use case, not an event handler (problem 1). Companion inputs are paths.domain,
  paths.eventList, paths.integrationEvents, paths.consumers, checks.dependencyDirection,
  checks.eventTests and infraModules (bus, mail and third-party clients).
trigger_when:
  - "Problem 1: a state change must trigger work in another bounded context or outside system, and a direct call couples them. Signal: a use case calls another context's API or module after saving."
  - "Problem 2: a side effect outside the database (email, bus, third-party API) runs before commit or without retry. Signal: send or publish inside or right after the transaction, no outbox."
  - "Problem 3: others must learn what happened (another context's projection, audit). Signal: polling or diffing another context's tables."
  - "Problem 4: consumers break on redelivery or reordering. Signal: a handler that increments or inserts with no record of what it processed."
do_not_use_when:
  - "The reaction lives in the same context and the same transaction: call it explicitly."
  - "No consumer exists yet: record the event (domain-modelling), publish nothing."
scope_and_approval: >
  Rule 1: an event is a past-tense fact from the domain's event list, never a command in disguise
  (SendWelcomeEmail). Rule 2: an event is written to the outbox in the change's transaction; nothing
  publishes directly. Rule 3: only the relay publishes, after commit, at least once. Rule 4: a
  consumer records the event id it processed in the same transaction as its effect. Rule 5: a
  consumer ignores an event older than the aggregate version it has seen; no ordering is assumed
  across aggregates. Rule 6: internal events never leave their context; other contexts get an
  integration event, a published contract with one producer. Rule 7: a contract carries ids and the
  facts of the change; carrying state for consumers is a declared choice in the contract. Rule 8:
  contract changes are additive; a breaking change is a new version. Rule 9: a failing consumer
  retries, then lands in a dead-letter with an alert; never silently dropped.
anti_patterns:
  - "Dual write: save, then publish to the bus."
  - "Dispatch before commit: an email for an order that rolled back."
  - "A command disguised as an event."
  - "Chains of in-process handlers that hide the flow."
  - "Internal domain events published to other contexts, coupling them to the model."
  - "A consumer that double-applies on redelivery."
  - "The whole aggregate as payload by default."
  - "Integration events published \"for later\" with no consumer."
  - "Consumer failures swallowed."
