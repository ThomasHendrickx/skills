# Writing a SKILL.md that compiles to AIP

SKILL.md is the source of truth; AIP is compiled from it, never written by hand. Whatever the source leaves vague, the compile guesses.

1. Anatomy: keep problems, solution, not-needed-when, rules, failure modes and procedures as separate numbered lists, one item per line. Each maps to one AIP field and is counted by a check. Scenarios stay outside the body.
2. Steps: one action per numbered step, tagged `script` (deterministic) or `agent`, with named inputs and outputs and a checkable completion. Every number a step or scenario cites (problem 1, rule 3) exists in the source.
3. Graph: one node per step, id `p<procedure>-<step>-<slug>`. One entry node, `depends_on` for order, typed inputs and outputs for data, output names unique so each input has one producer. A conditional step stays prose, not an edge. A gate's stop must not starve a later scenario's fixture.
4. Companion inputs: name what the repo companion supplies (paths, check commands, infra lists) as inputs. The skill ships no repo-specific check; a script node runs the command the companion declares.
5. Scripts: only for checks that need no judgement. Parse what you inspect (imports via the language's parser, never substring search). Unit test each with a case that fails the naive version.
6. Compile and validate: follow the pinned `aip` compiler skill, then run its validator on a folder named after the skill. Add a check that node counts, step kinds and cited numbers match the source. Commit the provenance (compiler tag and commit, field mapping) and the command output. A compiled form with no provenance reads as hand-written.
7. Prove on both forms: scenario rules live in `behaviour-driven-development`. Each scenario runs through a fresh agent following the form on a fixture, against SKILL.md and against AIP, with the same checks. Report each result as pass, fail or not run; a string match is not a run. One run is an observation, not a rate.
8. Before review, check for the failures seen in practice:
   - results marked pass without a run
   - AIP copied or hand-written instead of compiled
   - a procedure collapsed into one node
   - source paraphrased, losing the numbers the steps cite
   - a scan that matches text instead of structure
   - a scenario whose acceptance wording invites the forbidden behaviour
