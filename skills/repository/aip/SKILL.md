description: Use when an aggregate needs durable loading or saving, a need-named finder, or a replacement for generic repository calls.

```yaml
purpose: >
  One repository serves one aggregate root: load by id, save the whole aggregate, and provide
  need-named finders. The repository joins the use case unit of work and never commits. Contract
  tests run against in-memory and real adapters. Every list has a page request and the database
  pages. Display and report reads use a cqrs read model. Companion inputs are paths.domain,
  paths.ports, paths.adapters, paths.compositionRoot, checks.dependencyDirection, infraModules,
  and checks.contractTests.
trigger_when:
  - "Problem 1: an aggregate is loaded or saved in pieces, so invariants can break between calls. Signal: one use case writes several tables of one aggregate."
  - "Problem 2: in-memory and real adapters behave differently. Signal: no test suite runs against both."
  - "Problem 3: reads grow unbounded. Signal: a list method with no page request."
  - "Problem 4: query shape leaks through the port. Signal: a port parameter typed with an ORM type or a generic criteria object."
do_not_use_when:
  - "No invariant spans rows (single-table CRUD): no repository; ports-and-adapters decides if a port is needed at all."
scope_and_approval: >
  Rule 1: repositories exist only for aggregate roots; children load and save through their root.
  Rule 2: methods take and return domain types and ids; no ORM types, query builders or criteria objects.
  Rule 3: a finder is named for the need, never generic. Rule 4: every list method takes a page request.
  Rule 5: the repository never commits or opens a transaction. Rule 6: the in-memory adapter passes
  the same contract tests as the real one. P3 applies only to touched code.
anti_patterns:
  - "Generic base repository (Repository<T>, findAll, findBy)."
  - "findAll followed by filtering in code."
  - "A repository per table, children included."
  - "Business decisions inside a repository method."
  - "An in-memory fake that skips uniqueness, ordering or not-found."
  - "Dashboard or report reads added as repository finders."
